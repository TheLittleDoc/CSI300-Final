My idea for the general frontend structure is to have a heirarchical
set of lists that can be clicked through set up in this order

Courses -> Course Materials
  ||
  \/
Students -> Student Info
  ||
  \/
Student Grades

Essentially just a binary tree


Courses and Students will be lists where you can click on a specific entry
to move down the heirarchy

Whereas Course Materials, Student Info, and Student Grades wont be
interactive and will just display data


Example Queries for each section

Courses:

SELECT course_name
FROM Courses;


Course Materials:

SELECT CourseMaterials.course_material
FROM CourseMaterials
JOIN Courses ON CouseMaterials.course_id = Courses.course_id
WHERE Courses.course_name = varname;


Students:

SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM Students;


Student Info:

SELECT email, major, grad_year
FROM Students
WHERE student_ID = varname;


Student Grades:

SELECT quiz_1, quiz_2, project_1, project_2, final
FROM Grades
WHERE student_ID = varname
AND class_ID = varname2;
